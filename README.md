# Advent of Code 2023
This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023, implemented in Rust. For more information about the event, visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

The primary focus of this project is to maintain and enhance my skills in Rust, keeping up with the latest updates and features of the language.

I typically utilize three commands during development:
1. `cargo run --release` for running the application. 
2. `cargo test` for running tests. 
3. `cargo bench` for benchmarking performance.

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an online event created by Eric Wastl. It is an annual online coding challenge that starts on December 1st. It features a series of daily programming puzzles that unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5, or 06:00 EST/UTC+1 in my local time.
